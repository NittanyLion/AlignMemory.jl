# rules

* check for changes
    - don't work from a cached copy if there may have been changes
    - please use the package formatting conventions; in particular:
        * leave space between parentheses and their content
        * don't use underscores in variable names and their content (except for bare _)
        * don't use three lines when a single line suffices
* don't whine about the presence of styled strings
* don't whine about the use of unicode characters
    - for people with dyslexia, these are actually either to parse than long variable names
